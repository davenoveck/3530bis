  <section title="Named Attribute Definition">

    <t>
      The NFS version 4 protocol provides for the association of named
      attributes to files.  The name space identifiers for these attributes
      are defined as string names.  The protocol does not define the
      specific assignment of the name space for these file attributes.
      Even though the name space is not specifically controlled to
      prevent collisions, an IANA registry has been created for the
      registration of NFS version 4 named attributes.  Registration will
      be achieved through the publication of an Informational RFC and
      will require not only the name of the attribute but the syntax and
      semantics of the named attribute contents; the intent is to promote
      interoperability where common interests exist.  While application
      developers are allowed to define and use attributes as needed,
      they are encouraged to register the attributes with IANA.

  <section title="ONC RPC Network Identifiers (netids)">

    <t>
      <xref target="sec:sdts" /> discussed the r_netid field and
      the corresponding r_addr field of a clientaddr4 structure.
      The NFS version 4 protocol depends on the syntax and semantics
      of these fields to effectively communicate callback information
      between client and server.  Therefore, an IANA registry has been
      created to include the values defined in this document and to
      allow for future expansion based on transport usage/availability.
      Additions to this ONC RPC Network Identifier registry must be
      done with the publication of an RFC.
    </t>

    <t>
      The initial values for this registry are as follows (some of this
      text is replicated from section 2.2 for clarity):
    </t>

    <t>
      The Network Identifier (or r_netid for short) is used to specify a
      transport protocol and associated universal address (or r_addr for
      short).  The syntax of the Network Identifier is a US-ASCII string.
      The initial definitions for r_netid are:

      <list style='hanging'>
        <t hangText='"tcp"'>
          TCP over IP version 4
        </t>

        <t hangText='"udp"'>
          UDP over IP version 4
        </t>

        <t hangText='"tcp6"'>
          TCP over IP version 6
        </t>

        <t hangText='"udp6"'>
          UDP over IP version 6
        </t>
      </list>
    </t>

    <t>
      Note: the '"' marks are used for delimiting the strings for this
      document and are not part of the Network Identifier string.
    </t>

    <t>
      For the "tcp" and "udp" Network Identifiers the Universal Address
      or r_addr (for IPv4) is a US-ASCII string and is of the form:

      <figure>
        <artwork>
h1.h2.h3.h4.p1.p2
        </artwork>
      </figure>
    </t>

    <t>
      The prefix, "h1.h2.h3.h4", is the standard textual form for
      representing an IPv4 address, which is always four octets long.
      Assuming big-endian ordering, h1, h2, h3, and h4, are respectively,
      the first through fourth octets each converted to ASCII-decimal.
      Assuming big-endian ordering, p1 and p2 are, respectively, the first
      and second octets each converted to ASCII-decimal.  For example, if a
      host, in big-endian order, has an address of 0x0A010307 and
      there is a service listening on, in big endian order, port 0x020F
      (decimal 527), then complete universal address is "10.1.3.7.2.15".
    </t>

    <t>
      For the "tcp6" and "udp6" Network Identifiers the Universal Address
      or r_addr (for IPv6) is a US-ASCII string and is of the form:

      <figure>
        <artwork>
x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8.p1.p2
        </artwork>
      </figure>
    </t>

    <t>
      The suffix "p1.p2" is the service port, and is computed the same way
      as with universal addresses for "tcp" and "udp".  The prefix,
      "x1:x2:x3:x4:x5:x6:x7:x8", is the standard textual form for
      representing an IPv6 address as defined in Section 2.2 of
      <xref target="RFC2373" />.  Additionally, the two alternative forms specified in
      Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC2373" /> are also acceptable.
    </t>

    <t>
      As mentioned, the registration of new Network Identifiers will
      require the publication of an Information RFC with similar detail
      as listed above for the Network Identifier itself and corresponding
      Universal Address.
