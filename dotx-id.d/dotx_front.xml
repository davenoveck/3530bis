    <abstract>
      <t>
      The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed filesystem
      protocol which owes heritage to NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and
      version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4
      protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support
      for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for
      strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client
      caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course,
      attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an
      Internet environment.

      This document replaces RFC 3530 as the definition of the NFS version
      4 protocol.
